  <description>
    The second addon mod to Automatic Work Assignments. This addon introduces the ability perform tasks when certain events occurs in the game. This can be used for, among other things, set all colonists allowed area to a safe-zone when a threat appears.
    
    It works through a new "on event" on-assignment task. This allows you to set the event type, and the task that should be executed when the event is invoked. This system allows even automation, by providing the option to react dynamically.
    
    This was split into an addon, partially due to the scope of the feature, as well as potential performance concerns. Of course we strive for as little performance impact as possible, but the nature of the mod does require things that risk having a performance impact.
    
    So in order to only have this impact users that actually want the features, the mod was split into an addon.
